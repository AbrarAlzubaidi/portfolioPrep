[linkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/abraralzobaide/)

**computer engineer from Albalqa university. interested in programming, like how we can use code to make something, how to create a new program which is useful for some people, and how to make a machine work. Also, how to solve some problems using it. i have a Java course from beprogramming company. and now I am in scholarship with ASAC.i do not prefer to submit a job in computer engineering i don't like this field. it just like a gate (or we can say it is a general field) to know what branch i preferred (network, hardware, programming, communication, etc).
in the end i discovered i prefer programming after taking C++ course in the university and failed in midterm exam. after thinking seriously about dropping it or not, i made an extra effort to pass it, and pass it ^^. i like to do my job at evening cause i like quiet moments and places.**

### i want to be a software developer in a reputable company
